OOP stands for Object-Oriented Programming. It is a programming paradigm that organizes code into objects, which are instances of classes. Python is an object-oriented programming language that supports and encourages the use of OOP principles.

In OOP, objects are created from classes, which act as blueprints or templates for creating objects. A class defines the properties (attributes) and behaviors (methods) that an object can have. Here's a brief explanation of some key concepts in OOP:

Class: A class is a user-defined data type that defines a set of attributes and methods that objects can have. It serves as a blueprint for creating objects.

Object: An object is an instance of a class. It represents a specific entity that has its own set of attributes and can perform certain actions.

Attribute: An attribute is a characteristic or property associated with an object. It can be a variable that holds data.

Method: A method is a function defined within a class that can perform certain actions or operations on objects of that class. It defines the behavior of the class.

Encapsulation: Encapsulation is the principle of bundling data and methods together within a class. It allows for data hiding and ensures that the internal representation of an object is hidden from outside code.

Inheritance: Inheritance is the process by which one class inherits the properties and methods of another class. It promotes code reusability and allows for creating more specialized classes based on existing ones.

Polymorphism: Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. It allows for flexibility and dynamic behavior based on the actual object type at runtime
variables that belongs to an object are referred to as fields.
objects can also have functionality by using functions that belong to a class. such functions are called methods of the class. the field and method can be referred t as the attribute of that class
one of the major benefit of object oriented programming is the reuse of code and one of the ways this is achieved is through the inheritance mechanism
