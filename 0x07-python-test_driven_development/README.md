Unittest is a testing framework in Python that allows you to write and run tests for your code. It is part of the Python standard library and is commonly used for unit testing, which involves testing individual units or components of software to ensure they work correctly in isolation.

The unittest framework provides a set of tools and methods for defining test cases and assertions. It allows you to organize your tests into test cases, which are classes that inherit from the unittest.TestCase class. Within each test case, you can define individual test methods, which are functions that start with the word "test" and typically contain assertions to verify the expected behavior of the code being tested.
