Inheritance is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) that allows classes to inherit properties and methods from other classes. In Python, a class can inherit from another class, called the base class or superclass, by specifying the superclass name in parentheses after the class name.

Here's a brief explanation of how inheritance works in Python:

Base Class: A base class is the class from which other classes inherit. It defines the common properties and behaviors that can be shared by its subclasses.

Subclass: A subclass is a class that inherits from a base class. It can add additional attributes and methods or override the existing ones inherited from the base class.

Syntax: To create a subclass, you define a new class and specify the base class inside parentheses after the class name. For example:

python
Copy code
class SubClassName(BaseClassName):
    # Subclass attributes and methods
Inherited Features: The subclass inherits all the attributes (variables) and methods (functions) of the base class. It can access and use them as if they were defined within the subclass itself.

Overriding: If a subclass defines a method with the same name as a method in the base class, the subclass method overrides the base class method. This allows the subclass to provide its own implementation for that method.

Multiple Inheritance: Python supports multiple inheritance, which means a subclass can inherit from multiple base classes. To do this, you simply list all the base classes separated by commas in the class definition.

Inheritance promotes code reusability, as common attributes and methods can be defined in the base class and shared across multiple subclasses. It also allows for code organization and hierarchy, enabling the creation of specialized classes that inherit and extend the functionality of more general classes.
