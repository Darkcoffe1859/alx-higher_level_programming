This project involves everything that has been thought in python since the start of sprint 2
args and kwargs are mostly used in function definitions. *args and **kwargs allow you to pass a variable number of arguments to a function
python package is created and used in the project.import statement is used to import modules from the package created into the program. it allows us to aceess functions, classes, and varaibles defined in the modules and to be use in the code.
exceptions were used to handle errors and exceptional situations that occured during the execution of the program.
A class is a blue print for creating objects (instances)that share similar attributes and behaviours. it provides a way to define objects based on that blueprint.
a private attribute serve as a naming convention and a way to communicate that certain attribute or method are intended for internal use within the class.
a getter is a method used to retrieve the value of an attribute, while a setter is a method used to set the value of an attribute. they provide an addditional layer of abstraction and can be used to enforce data va.lidation, perofrm calculations, or apply any other logic before ggetting or setting the attribute value. 
a class method is a method that is bound to the class itself rather than an instance of the class
static methods are independent of the class or instance and are typically used for utility functions that do not require access to any instance or class specific data
inheritance promotes codes reusability and allows you to create a hierachy of classes, where child classes inherit and extend the functionality of the parent class and can also define its own unique attributesand methods.
unit tests are a type of software testing that focus on verifying the functionality of individual units or compounds of a software system.
a unit refers to the smallest testable part of an application, usually a function, method or class
